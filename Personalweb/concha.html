                <h2>Sports</h2>
                <p>Since my childhood, I've enthusiastically engaged in a variety of sports, experiencing the joy and benefits 
                    of physical activity. From swimming totennis,soccer, and badminton, I've embraced a diverse range of sports. Each activity has
                    not only been a source of enjoyment but also a journey of skill development, teamwork, and personal growth.
                    Through these experiences, I've cultivated a love for staying active and exploring different aspects of sportsmanship.</p>

                <h2>Arts</h2>
                <p>Art has always been a profound passion of mine, and I express my creativity through various styles and mediums.
                    In painting, I explore the vibrant world of watercolors, the boldness of acrylics, and the versatility of gouache,
                    allowing each piece to come to life in its unique way. Beyond the canvas, I find joy in crocheting, crafting accessories 
                    that reflect my personal style. The process of creating these pieces is not only a form of self-expression but also a means 
                    of spreading happiness, as I often share my creations as heartfelt gifts with others.</p>

                <h2>School/Learning</h2>
                <p>I find immense joy in the journey of learning and have a genuine fascination for discovering new things. 
                    The process of acquiring knowledge is not just a means to an end but a fulfilling experience in itself.
                    Learning constantly challenges me to grow and improve, contributing significantly to my personal development.
                    This passion for learning is a driving force behind my aspiration to become a neurosurgeon. I believe that by
                    expanding my knowledge base, I can better understand the intricacies of medicine and ultimately contribute to
                    helping those in need. Learning, for me, is not only fun but an essential part of my path toward making a positive impact on others' lives.</p>
